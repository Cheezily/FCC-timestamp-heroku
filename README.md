# FCC-timestamp-heroku

This is a simple application that returns a JSON object with a timestamp of both unix time and natural time based on what is entered into the url.  Checks are made to make sure the date passed is valid.

Examples of valid dates being attached to the url would be "/November%2019,%202012" or "/1453846847".
